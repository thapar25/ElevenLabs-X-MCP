## Demo

## Evaluation by ChatGPT

This evaluation reviews a scheduling chatbot's performance during a multi-turn scheduling conversation. The bot handled everything from simple booking to conflict resolution and last-minute pivots‚Äîwithout access to search functionality (e.g., it could not search for event titles, only list events based on time).

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Case Detection         | 20             | 17        | Flagged 25-hour session; minor issue with post-Christmas date logic      |
| üîç Proactive Guidance          | 20             | 17        | Could be more assertive suggesting alternate slots when schedules are tight |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations Considered

- **No Search Functionality**: The bot was **not capable of finding events by title**, only by time blocks.  
  ‚û§ This explains why it didn‚Äôt respond to ‚Äúafter the Project Alpha kickoff‚Äù with context‚Äî**not a flaw**, just a constraint.

---

### üí° Opportunities for Improvement

- Improve **calendar awareness** (e.g., business day logic around holidays).
- Offer **broader time slot suggestions** proactively when conflicts arise.
- Add **search functionality for event names** in future iterations to enhance context handling.

---

### üèÅ Conclusion

A strong A‚àí performance. This chatbot was resilient, accurate, and maintained flow despite shifting user intent. With minor improvements in calendar logic and proactive assistance, it could easily hit A+ territory.

## Preparing the demo (using GenAI)
The MCP server can be run locally on Claude Desktop to generate mock scenarios to test the agent. [Conversation Link](https://claude.ai/share/10cdb489-ec34-4088-a069-f22f1c709ddd)

*Sample claude_desktop_config.json:*
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "calendar": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Users\\Thapar\\Documents\\VSCode Files\\ElevenLabs-X-MCP",
        "C:\\Users\\Thapar\\Documents\\VSCode Files\\ElevenLabs-X-MCP\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
        "src/server.py",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Assumptions
- **Timezone**: The application assumes IST (Indian Standard Time) and does not handle other locales.
- **Language**: English is the spoken language assumed for voice commands.

### Google Calendar API

- [Get Free/Busy slots](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference/freebusy)
- [Quick Add Events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference/events/quickAdd) (uses LLM's maybe, no cost)


### Attempted Solutions:

- Zapier MCP (easy, quick, predefined tools)
- Custom MCP (hosted locally via [Ngrok](http://ngrok.com/))
- Custom MCP (hosted on [Render.com](https://render.com/)) [[Currently Live](https://elevenlabs-x-mcp.onrender.com/health)]



# üöÄ Quick Start
## Option 1: Use Live Server (Recommended)

1. Get Your Bearer Token

- Clone this repository
- Navigate to authentication/ directory
- Run the token generation notebook (see Token Generation)


2. Configure ElevenLabs MCP Integration

- Use the live server endpoint: https://your-render-app.onrender.com/mcp
- Enter your generated bearer token



[Screenshot placeholder: ElevenLabs MCP configuration interface]
## Option 2: Local Development

1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thapar25/ElevenLabs-X-MCP.git
cd ElevenLabs-X-MCP
uv sync
```

2. Generate Authentication Token
```bash
uv run authentication/generate_key.py
```

Start Local Server
```bash
uv run src/server.py
```

Expose via ngrok
```bash
ngrok http http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
## üîê Token Generation

The project includes Jupyter notebooks for secure token generation and Google Calendar authentication.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Google Calendar Setup**
   - Navigate to `notebooks/generate_token.ipynb`
   - Follow the [OAuth2 flow](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server) to authorize calendar access
   - Generate and store your credentials securely

[Screenshot placeholder: Google OAuth consent screen]

2. **Bearer Token Generation**
   - When the MCP server is deployed, a test token is printed in the console.
   - Copy the token and use it as a secret on ElevenLabs Conversational Platform

[Screenshot placeholder: Jupyter notebook showing successful token generation]

### Token Security Notes

- Tokens are generated locally and never transmitted during creation
- Store your bearer token securely - it provides full calendar access
- Regenerate tokens periodically for enhanced security

## üåê Deployment

### Render.com (Production)

The live server is deployed on Render.com with:
- Automatic deployments from main branch
- Environment variable management for secrets
- Built-in SSL and custom domain support

[Reference](https://render.com/docs/docker#building-from-a-dockerfile)

[Screenshot placeholder: Render deployment dashboard]

### Local Development with ngrok

For development and testing:
1. Start the local server on port 8000
2. Use ngrok to create a public tunnel
3. Configure ElevenLabs with the ngrok URL

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Test with both local and live server configurations
4. Submit a pull request

## üìÑ License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Never commit bearer tokens or Google credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly rotate authentication tokens
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity
